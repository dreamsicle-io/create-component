# Create Component

`create-component` is a node command line tool that will scaffold a new multi-file component directory with a project's often opinionated component structure, ideally containing just the right amount of starter code to get a developer started building. The difference between this generator and others is that the template is 100% controlled by the developers of the project.

## Usage

From the project directory root, fire the `create-component` command, pointing to any directory that contains a `_Template` directory.

```shell 
npx @dreamsicle.io/create-component [options] <name>
```

## Getting started

All that is necessary to start using the tool is a component name `name`, which corresponds to a pascal-cased string that will serve as the component name, and a relative `--path`/`-p` that contains a `_Template` directory.

### 1. Install

While it is possible to run this script without installing it by using `npx`, it is recomended to install the package to the project's development dependencies in order to be able to rely on the behavior of the script version to version.

```shell
npm install --save-dev @dreamsicle.io/create-component
```

### 2. Set up scripts

While it is possible to run this script directly, it is recommended that you add scripts to your `package.json` file in order to make using this tool easier and faster. The app structure isn't likely to change in any given project often, so this will help in making the usage more consistent.

The scripts `name` arg can be passed through to the script when running it through `npm`, therefore all that is recommended is to set up a script corresponding to each path that contains a `_Template` directory.

**Setting up scripts is simple ― consider an application with the following structure:**

```
/root
―――― /src
―――――――― /components
―――――――――――― /_Template
―――――――― /partials
―――――――――――― /_Template
―――――――― /pages
―――――――――――― /_Template
```

**A great way to set up the app in this case would be to add the following to the `scripts` key on the project root's `package.json`.**

```json
{
	"scripts": {
		"create-component": "create-component -p src/components",
		"create-partial": "create-component -p src/partials",
		"create-page": "create-component -p src/pages"
	}
}
```

### 3. Run the scripts

Given the scripts created in step #2 above, run them as follows ― being sure to provide a component name after the script name. These commands will clone the `_Template` directory in each of the corresponding project directories and will perform replacements both on the file names themselves as well as on the text content within the files.

```shell
npm run create-component MyComponent
```
```shell
npm run create-partal MyPartial
```
```shell
npm run create-page MyPage
```

> **Note:** Change `MyComponent`/`MyPartial`/`MyPage` to the desired component name.

## Replacements

The following table documents which text nodes will be operated on when the `_Template` directory is cloned. Use these anywhere within the content. For file name replacements, consult the `Runs on file name` column of the table below.

| Placeholder   | Replacement                     | Example           | Runs on content   | Runs on file name |
| ------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| `_Template`   | A pascal-cased component name   | `MyComponent`     | ✔️                | ✔️               |
| `_template`   | A param-cased component name    | `my-component`    | ✔️                | ✔️               |
| `_version`    | The root package's version      | `1.0.0`           | ✔️                | ❌               |
| `_date`       | The date as `m/d/yyyy`          | `3/23/2022`       | ✔️                | ❌               |

> **Note:** Version 2.0.0 will provide an API for adding custom replacements to the script.

## Logging

The tool will log its progress and errors in the console, exiting on completion and fatal errors.

```
⚡ Creating component: MyComponent

📁 Directory cloned: examples\components\MyComponent

🔨 File built: examples\components\MyComponent\utils\my-component-utils.ts

```

> **Note:** The above is what would be created and logged given a `src/components/_Template` directory with the following files: `_Template_.tsx`, `_Template_.scss`, `_Template_.stories.tsx`, and `_Template_.test.tsx`.

## Help 

To get help with the tool and to learn more about usage and the available options, use the `--help` or `-h` flag. This will output all help information available including how to use the command, option flags, option descriptions, and option defaults.

```shell
npx @dreamsicle.io/create-component --help
```

**The above would ouput the following help information:**

```
Usage: npx @dreamsicle.io/create-component [options] <name>  

Create a React component in the appropriate components directory.

Options:
  -V, --version      output the version number
  -p, --path <path>  The relative path where the template to be used lives.
  -h, --help         display help for command
```
